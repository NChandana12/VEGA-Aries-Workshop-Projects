🚀 Embedded Projects on VEGA Aries V3
Hands-On Workshop | VIT Chennai
🗓️ Feb 22 – Apr 14, 2025

🧠 Overview
This repository showcases three key embedded projects developed as part of a hands-on workshop on VEGA Processors and Ecosystem, conducted at VIT Chennai. All implementations are built on the VEGA Aries V3 Board, exploring real-time sensor interfacing, decision-based automation, and access control systems.

📦 Project List
1️⃣ F1 Reaction Time Tester – Reflex Challenge
A fast-paced game inspired by Formula 1 drivers’ reflexes:

🔴 Red LED + Buzzer cue → user taps touch sensor as fast as possible

⏱️ Calculates and displays reaction time via Serial Monitor

🏆 Tracks best time, average time, and test count

👉 Try to beat the average F1 driver’s reaction speed: 0.2–0.3 sec!

2️⃣ IR Proximity Alert System
An automated system with instant visual and audio cues:

🟩 Green LED (safe) when no object is nearby

🟥 Red LED + buzzer alert when object is detected

🛠️ Useful for obstacle detection, safety systems, etc.

3️⃣ RFID-Based Access Control with RYG LEDs
A simple access system using an RFID module and RYG LED logic:

✅ Green LED → Authorized UID → "Access Granted"

⚠️ Yellow LED → Wrong UID → "Access Denied"

⛔ Red LED → 3 wrong attempts → System blocks access

💡 A great foundation for smart door locks or attendance systems.
